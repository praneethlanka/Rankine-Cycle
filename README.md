# Rankine-Cycle
Calculates efficiency of Rankine Cycle.
Thanks To XSteam, I was able to calculate the enthalpy's at different points seamlessly.
Reheat cyle is working properly. Efficiencies for Reheat and normal cycles can be calculated.
I have to add the effect of the change in various parameters on the efficiency of the cycle and also plot the variation of efficiency witht these parameters.
