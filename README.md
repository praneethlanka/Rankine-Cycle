# Rankine-Cycle
Plots P-V and T-S diagrams to calculate efficiency of Rankine Cycle
Thanks To XSteam. I was able to calculate the enthalpy's at different points seamlessly
There are further addition that need to be done to this like adding the Regenerator cycle and calculating the efficiencies of the cycle
